# 🧩 Golang Microservice — Cassandra + Kafka Feed System

This project is a microservice-based feed system built with **Go**, **Apache Kafka**, and **Cassandra**.
It consists of two main services: **Server** and **Worker**, using **Kafka** for message passing and **Cassandra** for data storage.

```

### Components:

* **Server** — HTTP API for managing users, follows, and posts.
* **Worker** — consumes messages from Kafka and updates followers’ feeds.
* **Kafka** — message broker for asynchronous communication.
* **Cassandra** — database for storing users, posts, and feeds.

## 🚀 Running the Project
### 🔹 0. Generate TLS Certificates (required for local HTTPS testing):

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -new -key key.pem -out cert.pem -config san.cnf
```
> **Important** Put certificates into `certs` folder to create correct `server` and `worker` docker images

> **Important:** Ensure `san.cnf` includes the correct Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for your local server (`localhost`, IP, etc.)

### 🔹 1. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will start:

* **Kafka** (port `9092`)
* **Cassandra** (port `9042`)
* **Server API** (port `8080`)
* **Worker** (listens to Kafka)

> Make sure your Docker Compose file creates a keyspace named `feedapp` in Cassandra.

---

### 🔹 2. Run Locally (without Docker)

1. Make sure the following are running locally:

   * **Kafka** (`localhost:9092`)
   * **Cassandra** (`localhost:9042`) with keyspace `feedapp`

2. Start the server:

```bash
go run ./cmd/server
```

3. Start the worker in another terminal:

```bash
go run ./cmd/worker
```

## 🌐 REST API

| Method | Path                           | Description                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/users`                       | Create a new user                  |
| `POST` | `/follow`                      | Follow another user                |
| `POST` | `/posts`                       | Create a post and send it to Kafka |
| `GET`  | `/feed?user_id={id}&limit={n}` | Get a user’s feed                  |

### Example Requests

**Create a User**

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/users -d '{"username":"almaz"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Follow a User**

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/follow -d '{"user_id":1, "followee_id":2}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Create a Post**

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/posts -d '{"author_id":2,"body":"Hello world!"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Get a Feed**

```bash
curl "localhost:8080/feed?user_id=1&limit=10"
```

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes unit and integration tests:

* Kafka mocks (`internal/broker/mock_kafka.go`)
* Store mocks (`internal/store/mock_store.go`)
* Tests for all services (`cmd/server/server_test.go`, `cmd/worker/worker_test.go`)

Run all tests:

```bash
go test ./... -v
```

## 🧰 Configuration

| Variable              | Description                                   | Default          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `KAFKA_BROKER`        | Kafka broker address                          | `localhost:9092` |
| `KAFKA_TOPIC`         | Kafka topic                                   | `feed-topic`     |
| `KAFKA_GROUP_ID`      | Kafka consumer group ID (used by Worker only) | `worker-group`   |
| `KAFKA_WRITE_TIMEOUT` | Write timeout for Kafka messages              | `10s`            |
| `KAFKA_READ_TIMEOUT`  | Read timeout for Kafka messages               | `10s`            |

> Note: The server writes to Kafka without using `KAFKA_GROUP_ID`. Only the worker uses the group ID.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

* **Golang 1.22+**
* **Apache Kafka** — message broker

* **gocql** — Cassandra driver
* **segmentio/kafka-go** — Kafka library
* **Docker Compose** — development environment

## 🧠 Core Idea

This project simulates a social media feed system:

1. A user creates a post — the server saves it in Cassandra and sends a message to Kafka.
2. The worker reads the Kafka message and adds the post to all followers’ feeds.
3. The client retrieves the feed via `/feed`.

---

## ⚡ Load Testing Tool

This project includes multiple benchmarking tools for stress-testing the feed system:

### 1. End-to-End Bench (`e2e_bench`)  
Simulates real-world scenarios by creating users, establishing follows, posting messages, and verifying feed delivery:

* Creates multiple users concurrently.
* Randomly generates follow relationships between users.
* Publishes posts concurrently using configurable concurrency.
* Polls followers’ feeds until the posts are delivered or timeout occurs.
* Measures post delivery latency for each follower.
* Computes statistics: trimmed mean, p50, p90, p99.
* Exports latency data to `e2e_latencies.csv`.

#### Usage

```bash
go run bench/e2e_bench/e2e_bench.go \
    -server https://localhost:8080 \
    -users 50 \
    -follows 10 \
    -posts 100 \
    -c 20 \
    -timeout 10
```
### 2. HTTP Load Test (`http_load`)

Generates concurrent POST requests to the `/posts` endpoint to measure server throughput and latency:

* Creates a user per goroutine.
* Sends posts in parallel with configurable concurrency and duration.
* Collects per-request latency and HTTP response codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx).
* Computes trimmed mean latency and key percentiles (p50, p90, p99).
* Saves latencies to a CSV file for analysis.

#### Usage

```bash
go run bench/http_load/http_load.go \
    -server https://localhost:8080 \
    -duration 30 \
    -c 50 \
    -csv latencies.csv \
    -trim 1
```

### 3. Kafka Producer Benchmark (`kafka_producer`)

Measures Kafka throughput by producing a large number of messages concurrently:

* Sends messages in configurable batch sizes.
* Uses multiple worker goroutines for parallel publishing.
* Reports total messages, success/failure count, elapsed time, and throughput.

#### Usage

```bash
go run bench/kafka_producer/kafka_producer.go
```
